## Phase 2A — Core Editor & Metadata

### Enhancements

- [ ] **GOO-108** Tab key behavior in editor _(High)_
  Tab/Shift+Tab intercepted — no longer moves browser focus. Lists: indent/outdent ✓. Task items: indent/outdent ✓. Code blocks: insert/remove 2 spaces ✓. **Remaining:** Tab in normal paragraphs should insert/remove indentation (insertText with spaces not working in paragraph nodes — needs investigation).


## 🚀 Friends Beta Gate

_Must ship before sharing with anyone outside the team. External blocker: Apple Developer account ($99/yr)._

- [ ] **GOO-51** App branding _(Medium — friends beta blocker)_
  Icon, wordmark, color palette. Needed before any public presence. Tauri uses `apps/desktop/src-tauri/icons/` — multiple sizes required (32×32 to 512×512 + `.icns` for macOS).

- [ ] **GOO-52** Cross-platform builds + signing + GitHub Releases pipeline _(High — friends beta blocker)_
  `release.yml` triggered on `git tag v*`. Matrix: macOS (notarized via Apple Developer Program, `tauri-apps/tauri-action`), Windows (SmartScreen warning OK for Phase 2 beta), Linux (AppImage + deb, no signing needed).
  **One-time setup:** Apple Developer account → Developer ID cert → notarization credentials as GitHub secrets. `tauri-apps/tauri-action` automates sign + notarize on every tagged release. Budget ~2–3 hrs for first-time setup.

- [ ] **GOO-50** Auto-updater _(Medium — friends beta blocker)_
  `tauri-plugin-updater`. Check on launch → non-blocking banner ("Version X.X available — restart to update") → download + install + relaunch. Update server: GitHub Releases. Wire in before any external release.

- [ ] Misc dogfooding improvements.

## 🌐 Public Launch Gate (Phase 3)

_Required before the marketing site goes live and the download button appears._

- [ ] **GOO-53** Marketing site Phase 3 _(Medium — public launch blocker)_
  Phase 2.5 ✓ (landing page + email capture form live at pikos.app). Remaining for Phase 3:
  `/open` (open metrics), `/download` (release links), `/changelog`. See `features/marketing-site.md`.

- [ ] **GOO-117** Marketing site analytics _(Medium — public launch blocker)_
  Lightweight, privacy-first page view tracking. No cookies, no fingerprinting — consistent with the product promise.
  - Recommended: Plausible (self-hosted or $9/mo cloud) or Fathom. Both are GDPR-compliant out of the box.
  - Alternative: roll a minimal hit counter using a Cloudflare Worker + KV (free tier, zero third-party) — fits the local-first brand story.
  - Add the script tag to the Astro layout so all pages are tracked automatically.
  - Verify no PII is collected and document the provider choice in `features/marketing-site.md`.

- [ ] **GOO-118** About page on marketing site _(Low — public launch blocker)_
  Short `/about` page: who built it and why, the local-first philosophy, contact/feedback link.
  - One page, no photos required — words carry it.
  - Link from footer next to Privacy.

- [ ] **GOO-54** Privacy policy on marketing site _(Low — public launch blocker)_
  Plain language, one page at `/privacy`. Cover: what stays on device (everything), what leaves only with opt-in (email address you typed in), what is never collected (note content), how to export data. Link from footer.
